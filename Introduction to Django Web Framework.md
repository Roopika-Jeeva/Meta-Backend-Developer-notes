Introduction to Django Web Framework
Summary
This document provides an introduction to the Django web framework, a powerful Python-based tool used to create dynamic, database-driven web applications. The course is structured to simulate real-world scenarios, and participants will act as junior developers tasked with transitioning a static website for a fictional restaurant company, Little Lemon, into a dynamic web application. The course consists of five modules covering Django's core concepts such as Views, Models, and Templates, culminating in a final project where participants create a functional web application.

1. Introduction to Django
What is Django?
Django is an open-source web framework written in Python. It is widely used for building large-scale backend web applications. Key components of Django include handling databases, server logic, and delivering data to users via HTML.

Prerequisite Knowledge
To work with Django effectively, the following knowledge is required:

Databases: Understanding how data is stored and retrieved.
Python: Proficiency in Python is necessary since Django is Python-based.
HTML/CSS: These are required for structuring and styling web pages.
Additionally, Django introduces new workflows and concepts which will be explained throughout the course.

Course Context
In this course, you will assume the role of a junior developer working for a fictional restaurant company, Little Lemon. The primary objective is to transition the company's static website into a dynamic, database-driven web application using Django.

2. Course Structure and Key Modules
